# Line Sorting
This is a very simple script for **sorting lines** in your files. It sorts them **alphabetically** and has few options upon running. Keep your notes **organized**.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or above

## Running
```bash
python main.py
```

You will be asked for sorting options, just reply with **Y** / **N**

> NOTE: You should give **full paths** to desired files when they are not in the same folder as `main.py`
